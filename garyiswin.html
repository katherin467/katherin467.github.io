				<h2>Background</h2>
				<p style="font-weight:bold;">
					In current times of staying at home most of the day, many people are trying to find new hobbies, seek out 
					entertainment, and engage in unique, fun activities.
				</p>
				<p>
					When the COVID-19 pandemic forced people worldwide to stay at home, there was a complete change in lifestyle 
					that had to take place. Suddenly people were spending more time at home than before, and many worked from home 
					as well, only stepping out when necessary. With this development, many people started to explore new hobbies 
					and engage in entertainment they may not have had time for otherwise. There were many who also struggled to 
					spend time and connect with others, as the command to socially distance themselves only provided obstacles 
					to socialization. In such a setting of potential boredom and decreased social interaction, people seek ways 
					to fill their time with fun and make contact with other people, whether it be friends or even strangers. 
				</p>
				<br>

				<h2>The Planning Process</h2>
				<p>
					This may not be the first problem you think of when it comes to the everyday 
					issues one faces, but it is no less of a reality for people worldwide. 
				</p>
				<p>
					With this idea in mind (and the fact that most of the team enjoyed playing 
					video games in some capacity), we decided to create a video game.
				</p>
				<p>
					Deciding on what to create, on the other hand, was more of a creative challenge 
					than we thought. We asked ourselves, “Should we try to create something entirely 
					new?” “Should we stick to the genres of games that people are already familiar 
					with?” “How can we make sure that it ends up being fun?”
				</p>
				<p>
					Then one teammate suggested a competitive variant of the game Baba is You, and 
					the rest is history (nevermind the fact that the rest of us had never heard of 
					it before!). 
				</p>
				<p>
					Baba is You is "a puzzle game where the rules you have to follow are present 
					as blocks you can interact with. By manipulating them, you can change how the 
					game works, repurpose things you find in the levels and cause surprising interactions!"
					(-from its <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/736260/Baba_Is_You/">official 
					Steam page</a>). Since this is a single-player game, we decided to put a multiplayer
					twist on it, which would allow people to play matches against each other. 
				</p>

				<h2>Creating Sprites</h2>
				<p>
					Having taken up the title of User Interface Specialist, I was heavily involved 
					in the graphics and appearance of the overall game. And since Gary Is Win was 
					inspired by Baba is You, I wanted to keep the spirit of the original game’s 
					graphics and decided to create a similar pixelated, wobbly style for our project. 
				</p>
				<p>
					And thus began the asset creation process. It took a fair amount of time, as I 
					needed to first get familiar with Adobe Photoshop and Illustrator and then figure 
					out how to create the different sprites and animate them. Figuring all of this 
					out was definitely the most difficult part since I had never done anything like it 
					before. 
				</p>

					<p>Making sprites with alternate colors using piskelapp.com</p>
				</div>					
				<p>
					But my efforts paid off. After some experimentation, I was able to hand-draw and animate a variety of sprites, 
					and these were used in the final product of Gary Is Win. Here are some of them below: 
				</p>
				<div id="avatars">
					<img id="avatar" src="public/assets/garyiswin/slime.gif">
					<img id="avatar" src="public/assets/garyiswin/axolotl.gif">
					<img id="avatar" src="public/assets/garyiswin/cat.gif">
					<img id="avatar" src="public/assets/garyiswin/jellyfish.gif">
					<img id="avatar" src="public/assets/garyiswin/ninja.gif">
					<img id="avatar" src="public/assets/garyiswin/snake.gif">
				</div>
				<p>
					Even though creating these graphics was stepping out of my comfort zone at first, 
					I realized just how important it was to be flexible and sensitive to the needs of 
					the team. And in my case, trying something new turned out to be pretty fun!
				</p>
				<br>

				<h2>Building the Screen Layouts</h2>
				<p>
					Along with the making of the graphics, I helped to establish the high-level design 
					of various screens, including the main gameplay screen. Together with the rest of 
					the front end team, we constructed our designs in a collaborative project in BuilderX. 
				</p>
				<div id="bodyimg">                
					<img id="med-img" src="public/assets/garyiswin/garyiswin-firstbuilderx.png">
				</div>
				<br>
				<p>
					As it turned out, using BuilderX had its own share of difficulties. We were unable to 
					work on our shared project at the same time due to limited multi-user capability, and 
					our free trial of BuilderX would only be valid for 30 days. 
				</p>
				<p>
					Despite these obstacles, we were able to produce all the sample screens for Gary Is Win 
					and use them as the reference point for the final product.

				<h2>Conclusion</h2>
				<p>
					Together, the back-end and front-end teams were able to create a fun and functional 
					game! Despite all the difficulties we faced, I’m proud of what we were able to create 
					and learned that front-end development is something I really enjoy and want to move 
					forward with.
				</p>
				<p> Stepping out of my comfort zone and trying out new things was one of the 
					most fun parts about this project for me. The whole experience has shown me the 
					value of working with a team that can help each other out, and I'm looking forward to
					building more things that other people can enjoy.
