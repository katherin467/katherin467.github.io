					<p>ðŸ’­ "How might we help physically disabled individuals find accessible places more efficiently and reliably?"</p>
				</div>

				<div class="section">
					<h2>Background</h2>
					<p><a href="https://www.who.int/health-topics/disability#tab=tab_1" target="_blank">According to the World Health Organization</a>, an estimated 1.3 billion people - 
						about 16% of the global population - currently experience significant disability, a number that is increasing as time goes on. As such, 
						it's incredibly important to implement accessible services in both physical and digital contexts so that more people can receive equal treatment
						regardless of whether they have a disability or not. 
					</p>
					<p>However, although many countries, workplaces, and common spaces have put measures in place to assist disabled people and remove barriers they would otherwise
						face, accessibility is not widely supported everywhere and this lack of support remains a major obstacle to the daily lives of individuals with disabilities.
					</p>

					<div class="subsection">
						<h3>The Challenge</h3>
						<p>For UCSD's Startup Studio, our team was challenged to investigate a specific problem within the broad field of accessibility,
							 and design an innovative service addressing it. This included coming up with a prototype as well as writing a business plan.</p>
					</div>
					<div class="subsection">
						<h3>Our Solution</h3>
						<p>In the end, we created EasyAccess, a mobile app that allows users to explore and share up-to-date information about the 
							accessibility features and accommodations offered by businesses. 
						</p>
					</div>
					<div class="subsection">
						<h3>My Role</h3>
						<p>Over the course of this project, I contributed to all stages of the process, from initial ideation to the final design. 
						   I was especially involved in conducting user interviews as well as constructing the final interactive prototype. 
						   As a UI/UX Researcher and Designer, I collaborated with my team to complete our milestones and keep our target users in mind for the entire duration of the project.

					<h2>Discovery</h2>

					<div class="subsection">
						<h3>SET Analysis</h3>
						<p>To start, our team began examining the problem space and searching for a specific issue to focus on through a broad SET 
							(social, economic, technological) analysis. By doing so, we could gain 
							a better overall grasp of current accessibility services/trends and look for potential areas of improvement.</p>
						<div style="overflow-x:auto">
							<table id="set">
								<tr>
									<th>Social</th>
									<th>Economic</th>
									<th>Technological</th>
								</tr>
								<tr>
									<td>
										<ul>
											<li>Gradual reduced stigmatization against mental illnesses & disabilities</li>
											<li>Increased digital accessibility due to pandemic as many services are online/virtual</li>
											<li>Awareness and promotion for mental health, inclusion, diversity</li>
											<li>Emphasis on ability-based design</li>
										</ul>

										<ul>
											<li>Automation of objects</li>
											<li>Keyboard accessibility for people who are blind, have motor disabilities, tremors, little use of hands/no hands</li>

											<li>Bluetooth or wireless connection between devices</li>
										</ul>
									</td>
								</tr>
							</table>
						</div>
						<br>
						<p class="listp">Based on these factors, we came up with several Product Opportunity Gaps:</p>
						<ul>
							<li>Help individuals find more accessible public spaces</li>
							<li>Promote awareness and resources for accessibility</li>
							<li>Aid local businesses with ADA compliance</li>
							<li><b>Business side:</b> help businesses learn how to improve accommodations</li>
							<li><b>Customer side:</b> a service that provides accurate and verifiable information about accessibility</li>
						</ul>
					</div>
					<div class="subsection">
						<h3>Launching our Survey</h3>
						<p>Having narrowed down our focus a little more, we then began looking for input and insights from 
							people facing accessibility-related issues to better understand the sorts of challenges they frequently 
							face in real life.
						</p>
						<p class="listp">We created an online survey and found that:</p>
						<ul>
							<li><b>85%</b> of participants have faced or know someone who has faced accessibility issues
							<img class="mediumimg" alt="survey pie chart" src="public/assets/easyaccess/surveyimg1.png"/></li>
							
							<li><b>School, work, and transportation</b> are the top places where people experience accessibility issues
							<img class="mediumimg" alt="survey bar graph" src="public/assets/easyaccess/surveyimgalt.png"/></li>

						</ul>
						<p class="listp">When asked what they wished the general public knew, participants said: </p>
						<ul>
							<li>People with disabilities are people too, who can still do things (they're not incapable)</li>
							<li>Awareness of accessibility options for those that need it</li>
						</ul>
					</div>
					<div class="subsection">
						<h3>Competitive Analysis</h3>
						<p>To get a better idea of what kinds of services are already provided in the field of accessibility, we conducted a 
							competitive analysis on some notable applications within our target focus area. 
						</p>
						<div id="competdiv">
							<img id="compet" alt="table listing other accessibility-related services" src="/public/assets/easyaccess/competitiveanalysis.png"/>
						</div>
						<p class="listp">From this analysis, we noticed a couple of recurring problems that could be improved:</p>
						<ul>
							<li>Lack of in-depth accessibility options</li>
							<li>Inability to report inaccuracies/edit reviews</li>
						</ul>
					</div>
					<div class="subsection" >
						<h3>Mission Statement</h3>
						<div class="emphasis">
							<p> ðŸ’¡   We aim to provide people who have accessibility issues with the necessary 
							information to live daily life more comfortably.</p>
						</div>
					</div>
				</div>

				
				<div class="section">
					<h2>Understanding our Users</h2>

					<div class="subsection">
						<h3>User Interviews</h3>
						<p>
							In order to understand our users on a deeper level, we reached out to some survey
							respondents who indicated that they were open to a brief virtual interview. 
						</p>
						<p>
							We ended up interviewing 5 people, 3 of whom had varying disabilities and needs
							for accommodation, and 2 who were caregivers of someone facing accessibility issues.
						</p>
						<img class="mediumimg" src="public/assets/easyaccess/interview-insights.png"/>
						<p>
							We also created 6 storyboards addressing various scenarios they may face and asked our interviewees to 
							indicate which solutions seemed the most useful, based on their own experience. 
						</p>
						<p>
							The most popular storyboard was the one proposing a way to check the accessible 
							facilities of restaurants/businesses, with <b>4 out of 5</b> interviewees viewing 
							it as the most helpful potential solution. 
						</p>
						<div id="storyboarddiv">
							<img id="storyboard" src="public/assets/easyaccess/storyboard.png"/>
						</div>

						<p class="listp">Here's what some of our interviewees had to say:</p>
						<div>
							<div id="quotediv">
								<span class="bigquote">ðŸ™¶</span>
								<p class="quote">
									[It] eliminates having to go out of your way to see if something is accessibleâ€¦ don't need to physically check out the location.
								</p>
								<span class="bigquote" style="align-self:end">ðŸ™·</span>
							</div>
							
							<div id="quotediv">
								<span class="bigquote">ðŸ™¶</span>
								<p class="quote">
									I resonate with thisâ€¦ Often times I want to explore a new building only to find out when I get there that it's not accessible, even when it claims to be.
								</p>
								<span class="bigquote" style="align-self:end">ðŸ™·</span>
							</div>
						</div>
						
						<img />
					</div>
					<div class="subsection">
						<h3>Value Flow Diagrams</h3>
						<p>
							Looking at the situation from a business perspective, we identified a general area of 
							mutual tension between disabled individuals and public institutions/businesses. For 
							those with accessibility needs, there is lack of information regarding whether or not a business
							provides the necessary accommodations; for businesses, they lose out on potential customers
							that they might have gained otherwise. 
						</p>
						<img src="public/assets/easyaccess/value flow diagram.png"/>
						<p>
							By creating a service to facilitate between the two and allow both sides to contribute 
							information, we can help fulfill present needs from both parties. Users would be able to 
							view/give reviews on facilities provided, and businesses may gain increased customer 
							engagement as well as improve accommodations based on feedback. 
						</p>
						<img src="public/assets/easyaccess/envisioned value flow diagram.png"/>
					</div>
					<div class="subsection">
						<h3>Narrowing it Down</h3>
						<p>
							Based on our research and understanding of the problem space, we decided to create 
							EasyAccess: a service that aims to provide up-to-date, verified accessibility 
							information about businesses and public institutions. 
						</p>
						<img id="logo" src="public/assets/easyaccess/logo trans bg.png"/>
						<p class="caption">Explore public spaces, with accessibility guaranteed by real people.</p>
					</div>
				</div>

				
				<div class="section bgcolored">
					<h2>Design and Marketing</h2>
					<img alt="easyaccess moodboard" src="public/assets/easyaccess/moodboard.png"/>
					<div class="subsection">
						<h3>Brand Identity</h3>
						<p class="listp">
							In creating the visual brand and identity of EasyAccess, we had a couple of key ideas we wanted
							to build around: 
						</p>
						<ul>
							<li>high visual/color contrast, for better readability</li>
							<li>simple, easy-to-read typography for easier readability and compatibility with screen readers</li>
						</ul>
						<div id="brandimgs">
							<img class="smallerimg" alt="typography guide featuring helvetica now text and graphik fonts" src="public/assets/easyaccess/typography.png"/>
							<img class="smallerimg" alt="color guide featuring navy blue, sky blue, and orange" src="public/assets/easyaccess/colorscheme.png"/>
						</div>
						
						<p>
							For our color scheme, we decided to use <b style="color:#253C7F;">navy blue</b> and 
							<b style="color:#FA7E0C">orange</b> as our main colors. Blue is a color
							often associated with calmness and modernity, while orange provides feelings of cheerfulness
							and a strong visual contrast as blue's complementary color.
						</p>
					</div>
					
					<div class="subsection">
						<h3>Web Probe</h3>
						<p>
							Once we had decided on our brand, we needed to gauge how successful our business idea was 
							among our intended users. To do so, we 
							created two different landing pages and advertisements for our service: one 
							geared towards our <b>target users</b>, and one towards <b>businesses owners</b> interested in joining. 
						</p>
						<p>
							We then conducted an A-B 
							test on them to see how each side would perform in terms of internet reach. This would help us obtain
							a better sense of online demand and inform our approach towards the promotion of our service. 
						</p>
						<div id="landingpages">
							<div class="landingpage">
								<p><b>Landing Page Ver. A: <br>Disabled Individuals</b></p>
								<img src="public/assets/easyaccess/landingpagea.png"/>
							</div>
							<div class="landingpage">
								<p><b>Landing Page Ver. B: <br>Business Owners</b></p>
								<img src="public/assets/easyaccess/landingpageb.png"/>
							</div>
						</div>
						<div id="landingpages">
							<div class="landingpage">
								<p><b>Ad Ver. A: <br>Disabled Individuals</b></p>
								<img src="public/assets/easyaccess/ad a.png"/>
							</div>
							<div class="landingpage">
								<p><b>Ad Ver. B: <br>Business Owners</b></p>
								<img src="public/assets/easyaccess/ad b.png"/>
							</div>
						</div>
						<p class="listp">
							Version B ended up performing significantly better than Version A: 
						</p>
						<div class="imgwcaption">
							<p><b>Ad Ver. A Results (Google Ads)</b></p>
							<img src="public/assets/easyaccess/ad a results.png"/>
						</div>
						<div class="imgwcaption">
							<p><b>Ad Ver. B Results (Google Ads)</b></p>
							<img src="public/assets/easyaccess/ad b results.png"/>
						</div>
						<br>
						<p>
							Though we hadn't anticipated such a stark difference, we felt there were several reasons for it. 
						</p>
						<ul>
							<li>Version B had a <b>more impactful and relevant headline</b>, that the target audience (business owners) was more likely to search up.</li>
							<li>In comparison, Version A's target audience (people with accessibility issues) is <b>much more niche</b>.</li>
							<li>Though relevant, Version A's keywords were <b>not popular</b>, so they were less likely to be searched up.</li>
						</ul>
						<p>Though Version B proved to have a promising amount of interest, we learned that we needed to 
							further improve the way we promote our service by choosing better keywords and emphasizing how 
							our solution differs from others moving forward. 
						</p>
					</div>

					<div class="subsection">
						<h3>Testing our Concierge MVP</h3>
						<p>
							Next, we needed to test out our solution to find out if it helps our intended users the way
							we have designed it. Once we created our <b>concierge MVP (minimum viable product)</b>, we asked 
							two of our prior interviewees to test it out and give their honest opinions on the service. 
						</p>
						<img src="public/assets/easyaccess/lofi.png"/>
						<p>
							We created a low-fidelity prototype of EasyAccess as our MVP and conducted Zoom calls
							with our two volunteers. For each one, we presented a scenario related to finding accessible
							places and walked through our prototype to show how it would be used to find a solution. Lastly,
							we asked for their thoughts on our app and whether or not they see it as viable. 
						</p>
						<p class="listp" style="color:#FA7E0C;">
							2/2 volunteers:
						</p>
						<ul>
							<li>found the application <b>useful and helpful</b></li>
							<li>mentioned they <b>would use the application</b></li>
							<li>mentioned that not many places provide accessibility reviews, making it unique</li>
						</ul>
						<div id="quotediv">
							<span class="bigquote">ðŸ™¶</span>
							<p class="quote">
								[T]he application would help third world countries or other places less familiar with accessibility learn more about accessibility and its importance.
							</p>
							<span class="bigquote" style="align-self:end">ðŸ™·</span>
						</div>
						<p class="listp">Our interviewees also provided some helpful suggestions:</p>
						<ul>
							<li>Account for different wheelchair sizes</li>
							<li>Include more accessibility options</li>
							<li>Consider adding search bar to the filter</li>
						</ul>

					<h2>Pitching Our Innovation</h2>
					<p>For the last steps of this project, our team created the Hi-Fi prototype for EasyAccess as well as a

					<h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
					<div class="subsection">
						<h3>Next Steps</h3>
						<p class="listp">Given the time to further develop EasyAccess, we would like to: </p>
						<ul>
							<li><b>Revise and update our budget and growth model</b> using revenue from our Kickstarter pledges</li>
							<li><b>Initiate alpha and beta tests</b> on our current Hi-Fi prototype to receive feedback and refine it</li>
							<li><b>Conduct additional in-depth market research</b> on common accessibility options that people look for within businesses/public institutions</li>
							<li><b>Work with business owners</b> to find additional ways to support their business through our app</li>
						</ul>
					</div>
					<div class="subsection">
						<h3>Reflection</h3>
						<p>
							Working on this project taught me a lot, both about the experiences of people with disabilities today and of
							the design process in the context of creating a business service from scratch. In the beginning, we spent a lot of 
							time getting acquainted with the broad area of accessibility and the challenges of individuals with these issues
							so that our solution would be both relevant and useful for them. For me, it highlighted the 
							importance of giving our care and attention to people whose needs often go unnoticed, and making an effort to help make
							their daily lives easier without being disrespectful. 
						</p>
						<p>
							At the same time, constructing a start-up service was no easy task - the conditions of this situation forced 
							us to stay practical and reasonable with our model. This is the first time that I've had a look at a design
							issue through a business perspective and while a lot of the process was very new to me, it gave me a more
							realistic taste of what it entails to create a start-up with limited resources. 
						</p>
						<p>
							Finally, a huge thank-you to my teammates, Erica, Bomed, and Sharon for their work in bringing this project to life!
