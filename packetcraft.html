					<p><a href="https://www.packetcraft.com/" target=_blank>Packetcraft</a> is a software-focused company, centered on the development of complete 
						and versatile software that can be used by other potential companies. These clients 
						can then combine Packetcraft's software with their own hardware to manufacture their products.</p>
					<p>Though Packetcraft itself is not directly involved in the production of end-user 
						merchandise, it still needed a way to <b>demonstrate the capabilities of its software to 
						potential clients</b>, including its Bluetooth LE microphone/receiver software. </p>
					</div>
					<div class="subsection">
                        <h3>My Role</h3>
						<p>As Associate UI/UX Engineer, I oversaw key design decisions for this microphone/receiver project.</p>
						<p class="listp">The two main tasks I completed were:</p>
						<ol>
							<li>Determine LED specifications of the mic/receiver hardware prototype, and</li>
							<li>Create the design for the corresponding demonstrative mobile app.</li>
						</ol>
					</div>
				</div>
                
				<div class="section">
					<h2>LED Research</h2>
					<div class="subsection">
						<p>Overall, I focused on various principles of user experience and product design 
						when creating the LED specifications of the mic/receiver hardware prototype. </p>
						<p class="listp">In summary:</p>
						<ul>
							<li>I familiarized myself with similar Bluetooth microphones on the market and their 
								LED usage to better understand how to <b>communicate multiple messages effectively</b></li>
							<li>I considered <b>color theory</b> when designating colors to certain meanings</li>
							<li>I accounted for <b>every use case</b> that the mic/receiver software can accommodate to 
								fully display its capabilities</li>
						</ul>
					</div>

					<h2> Mobile App Lo-Fi Design</h2>

					<div class="subsection">
						<h3>Initial Design</h3>
						<p>To create the wireframes/prototype for this app, <b>I learned how to use Adobe XD</b>, 
							which I could pick up quickly thanks to various online tutorials and my familiarity 
							with similar prototyping tools.</p>
						<p>First, I worked on creating some preliminary lo-fi screens covering the key functionalities 
							of Packetcraft's software.</p>

							<img src="public/assets/packetcraft/lofi_settings.png" />
							<img src="public/assets/packetcraft/lofi_fwupgrade.png" />

							<img src="public/assets/packetcraft/lofi_pairing_2.png" />
							<img src="public/assets/packetcraft/lofi_pairing_3.png" />
						</div>
					</div>
					
					<div class="subsection">
						<h3>Gathering Feedback</h3>
						<p>Once I had completed the general structure of the lo-fi prototype, I conducted a couple of 
							user tests on current Bluetooth microphone/headset users. I aimed to test how intuitive it 
							was for users to navigate through the app and perform several key tasks, including successfully 
							pairing a device and upgrading its firmware. </p>
						<p>Additionally, I presented my lo-fi prototype to the larger team working on this project in order 
							to gain early feedback from them on the design's current progress.</p>
					</div>

					<div class="subsection">
						<h3>Key Takeaways</h3>
						<p>I ended up receiving some very valuable feedback from both my interviews and my team critique. </p>
						<div class="leftbordered">
						<p class="listp">Feedback from User Interviews:</p>
						<ul>
							<li>Some in-app instructions, such as device pairing, were not intuitive enough</li>
							<li>The display of certain device information felt disorganized/unnecessary</li>
						</ul>
						<p class="listp">Feedback from Team Critique:</p>
						<ul>
							<li>Important to keep user persona in mind - Packetcraft's customers, as well as end users</li>
							<li>Distinguish functionality for two main use cases (microphone vs. PA system)</li>
						</ul></div>
						<p>From this, I learned that I needed to focus on <b>clearly defining the target audience</b>. Due to the 
							nature of the app being mostly demonstrative and geared towards other companies, I hadn't been sure 
							to what extent I should consider the end customer in my design. However, after talking to the team, 
							I realized that the app also functions as a way for our clients to <b>determine the look and feel of 
							their own app.</b></p>
						<p>In this way, I saw that it's still important to <b>keep the end user in mind</b>. Understanding this 
							clarified how I should approach the design - simplifying processes and displays for the average 
							Bluetooth microphone user, while still providing all the advanced settings that our clients would 
							be interested in. </p>

					<h2>Challenges</h2>
					<div class="subsection">
						<p>Working on this project exposed me to new situations as a UI/UX designer and an industry 
							design niche that I was unfamiliar with. </p>
						<p><b>Unlike the type of projects I've worked on in the past</b>, this microphone project was not 
							directly geared towards end-stage target users - in this case, Bluetooth microphone consumers. </p>
						<p>This prototype was being made to help demonstrate Packetcraft's software to other companies, 
							so the designs for both the prototype device's I/O and its associated mobile app were not 
							actively geared toward end-microphone users. </p>
						<p>Throughout this process, I faced questions such as: how can I construct a design rationale for 
							my work when it's contained within an <b>intermediary stage</b> of a larger context? How should I go 
							about performing <b>human-centered design</b> when my work is situated in such an early stage of 
							product development? </p>
						<p>Receiving feedback from the team and user interviews helped me realize that although the context 
							of my work didn't directly involve end users, there is still value in <b>designing with the end 
							user in mind</b>. Business clients viewing this mobile prototype would benefit from an intuitive 
							experience so that they <b>understand the capabilities of Packetcraft's software</b>. Furthermore, a 
							user-centric design can help them consider how to best approach their own product/mobile app, 
							which ultimately ends up with users. </p>
					</div>
				</div>

				<div class="section bgcolored">
					<h2>Hi-Fi Prototype</h2>
					<div class="subsection">
						<p>Using the feedback I received, I built the hi-fi prototype for the app, incorporating 
						Packetcraft's branding/design elements. Here are some of the final screens: </p>
						<p class="copyright">Copyright © 2022 Packetcraft, Inc. Uploaded with permission.</p>
						<div class="hifigallery">
							<img src="public/assets/packetcraft/hifi_main_1.png"/>
							<img src="public/assets/packetcraft/hifi_main_2.png"/>
							<img src="public/assets/packetcraft/hifi_settings_1.png"/>
							<img src="public/assets/packetcraft/hifi_settings_2.png"/>
							<img src="public/assets/packetcraft/hifi_pairing_1.png"/>
							<img src="public/assets/packetcraft/hifi_pairing_2.png"/>
						</div>

						<p>Additionally, I drafted a UI/UX document that further explained the hardware prototype's 
						functionality, including a guide for the LED colors and blinking patterns. This acted as a 
						<b>helpful reference</b> for Packetcraft's software developers in creating the underlying code, as 
						well as for clients to understand the prototype's capabilities and see what Packetcraft's 
						software has to offer.</p>
					</div>
				</div>

				<div class="section">
					<h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
					<div class="subsection">
						<h3>Next Steps</h3>
						<p class="listp">If I had more time to work on this project, I would: </p>
						<ul>
							<li>Conduct <b>additional iterations of user testing</b> on the hi-fi prototype</li>
							<li>Experiment with different <b>colors/components</b> in the final design</li>
							<li>Ensure <b>smooth transition from design to code</b> with the app developers</li>
						</ul>
					</div>
					<div class="subsection">
						<h3>Reflection</h3>
						<p>Working on this project was a very valuable experience that taught me a lot about designing 
							software prototypes for hardware products. While designing for the intended audience of this 
							prototype was a new and unfamiliar process at first, I learned some important lessons about 
							how user-centered design is vital, even in the early stages, of any product that will 
							eventually find its way to users.</p>
						<p>I enjoyed taking ownership of various design decisions made throughout this process, many of 
							which were informed by the crucial feedback I received from my interviewees as well as the 
							rest of the project team. This experience also strengthened my commitment to creating useful 
							and intuitive designs by defining the intended audience clearly and prioritizing all aspects 
							of their perspective in the final product.</p>
						<p>Finally, I'd like to thank Packetcraft for the opportunity to work on this project!</p>
