				<h2>Background</h2>
				<p>
					It’s not always easy to pay attention in class. This is all the more true for online classes, 
					where lectures take the form of videos on the student’s screen, no longer inside of the classroom 
					or lecture hall. This past year has seen the rise of virtual learning as a necessity for countless 
					students, and with it, a new series of educational challenges. Students that once experienced class 
					in a productive learning environment were now staying at home, where they had to carve out space for 
					themselves to attend school without leaving their place of residence. 
				</p>
				<p>
					Unfortunately, this situation 
					is not without its drawbacks - students are exposed to a multitude of distractions, whether from 
					family, roommates, pets, and even their own technological devices, which often hinder productivity 
					in and of themselves. With these distractions, combined with the increased distance between the 
					individual and their virtual lecture, it’s easy to see how these students can struggle to stay 
					engaged with their classes.
				</p>
				<blockquote>
					Virtual classes, while more flexible than their traditional counterparts, present new 
					challenges for students, forcing them to reforge their study habits as they try to stay 
					on top of their lectures and be free of distractions. 
				</blockquote>
				<br>
				
				<h2>Needfinding and Storyboards</h2>
				<p>
					Despite the difficulties of meeting with people during the pandemic, we began our creative 
					process by needfinding among fellow students to see what kinds of issues they were having. 
				</p>
				<p>
					So many schools and universities use online tools such as Canvas to help students keep track 
					of their classes and assignments, but not every tool is perfect. From the results of our needfinding, 
					my team observed that Canvas can be overwhelming at times for students, with files floating around 
					numerous categories and making it difficult at times to find what we need. 
				</p>				
				<p>
					With this in mind, and recognizing the fact that Canvas was not specifically designed for online 
					learning, we strove to create a platform where students wouldn’t feel lost or disengaged; we wanted 
					them to gain insight on what they are learning at the moment and what tasks they need to do (hence the app name). 
				</p>

					<p id="caption">Right: Storyboard idea of Q&A platform, where students can ask specific questions about lectures and communicate with fellow students.</p>
				</div>
				
				<p>
					Next, we created storyboards to map out our ideas, to brainstorm ways that our app could be useful for people in 
					real-life scenarios.
				</p>
				<br>

				<h2>Prototypes</h2>

				</div>
				<p id="caption">Initial grayscale and color prototypes, done in Figma. </p>
				<p>
					Since we were building our app with virtual students in mind, and we were virtual students, we decided to ask 
					ourselves: what sorts of features would we want from our app? What does Canvas lack in terms of ease of use?
				</p>
				<p>
					Since we all wanted to easily see what tasks we need to do, we decided to create a to-do list on the homepage 
					with links to the corresponding tasks. And to stay engaged with lectures, we all thought it would be great to 
					be able to take notes at specific timestamps of a given lecture video. 
				</p>
				<p>
					Using both paper and Figma, we also created prototypes to help simulate the flow of our app and subject our 
					design to user testing.
				</p>
				<br>

				<h2>User Testing and Development</h2>
				<p> 
					To test our design, we asked a few sample users to try navigating around our app and mention any confusions
					and suggestions they had. For instance, 
				</p>
				<p>
					This was a crucial step for the development of our project because it let us know what the flaws in our design 
					were, particularly with the icons and buttons (or lack thereof). Thanks to this feedback, we were able to bring 
					even more clarity to our design and account for features we overlooked (such as a logout button!). We learned
					that as designers, providing visual options for users is absolutely crucial for their understanding and use of 
					any app. 
				</p>
				<p>
					Then came the part where we needed to build what we had been envisioning. It was time to bust out the HTML, CSS, 
					and JavaScript.
				</p>
				<p>
					Over the course of a few weeks, we worked on our web app and were able to implement both the to-do list and the 
					lecture note taking functionality.
				</p>
				<br>

				<h2>Conclusion</h2>
				<p>
					Building this app alongside my time was a very valuable experience for me. Not only did I get to explore web
					development, I also experienced what it was like to conduct a user-centered design process comprised of distinct
					stages of needfinding, prototype creation, and user testing. 
				</p>
				<p> 
					Insight was born out of a desire to bring more clarity to the tools we use for virtual education,
					and reflects my own personal goals to build things that are easy for people to understand and use. 
				</p>
				<p>
					Though it’s not quite ready to challenge Canvas yet, I’m proud of what we were able to create as a team, and I’m 
					excited to build more like it in the future.
